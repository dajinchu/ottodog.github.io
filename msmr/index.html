            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Scientists created genetically modified organisms that require an artificial nutrient found only in laboratories. This greatly reduces the risk of radically modified organisms entering and disrupting  ecosystems.</p>

        <p>In this case, researchers had created E. Coli (pictured above), which is commonly used in research, with drastically different genomes that could potentially be harmful to wild ecosystems, so they added a safety measure to cause the bacterium to die when removed from the source of artificial amino acids produced in the lab.</p>

            <div class="core">
            <h2>Core</h2>
            <h3>Background Information</h3>
            <p>The bacterium E. coli uses DNA to store its genetic code. This DNA is made of a set of molecules, each of which can be represented as a letter. These letters tell the cell how to make proteins, the main actors of cells, out of strings of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. The cell picks which amino acid to use by reading the DNA in groups of three. Each of the 64 possible three letter combinations, known as codons, correspond to one of the 20 naturally occuring amino acids.</p>

            <h3>Previous Experiments</h3>
            <p>In 2013, researchers made drastic changes to the DNA of E. coli by swapping out every instance of select codons with different codons that corresponded to the same amino acid, allowing the cell to assemble the exact same protein using a significantly modified DNA sequence. Although this did cause the cell to become more resistant to viruses, it also caused the cell to pose a new threat to natural ecosystems by potentially introducing wildly different genetics.</p>

            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>If this safety lock mechanism is implemented, then the GMOs will not be able to escape their biocontainment mechanisms using compounds from their environment, and will exhibit resistance to a change in their DNA.</p>

            <h3>Methodology</h3>
                 <img src="http://hms.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/news/Mandell%20ecoli.jpeg" class="fullwidth" alt="E. Coli Bacterium locked in place" title="E. Coli Bacterium locked in place" width="100%">
                <p>In this experiment, instead of swapping equivalant codons, scientists rewired one of the redundant codons to correspond with an amino acid made synthetically in a lab. Computational tools were used to incorporate the artificial amino acid into newly designed proteins essential to the cell's function, causing an </p><p class="quote">"irreversible, inescapable dependency."</p> <p>Without this synthetic amino acid, the cell was not able to create the necessary proteins to function. Therefore, the researchers effectively locked the cell (as shown above) into ecosystems that contain the synthetic amino acid.</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>The researchers ended with three redesigned proteins and two dependent E. coli strains. By using three of these proteins rather than just one, it makes it harder for the E.coli to "escape." During the course of this experiment, a total of one trillion E.coli cells were grown. After two weeks, none of them had escaped which speaks to the tremendous success of this experiment.</p>

            <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The E. Coli used in this research can produce proteins not found in nature and are sometimes more resistant to viruses. Ensuring their containment in laboratories ensures that these organisms with wildy new genomes do not upset existing ecosystems.</p>
            <p>In the future, Church wants to require even more synthetic amino acids to make it even harder, even near impossible, for the E.coli to "escape."</p>
