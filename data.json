The beginning of the year focuses on modeling complex math problems, often with ones without a singular correct answer. We transition to smaller daily math problems from a packet, learning by solving problems rather than being taught directly."},
         {"p":"HiMCM is a math competition we do in October. The problem is released at 4am, and is due 4pm the next day, giving contestants 36 hours to solve it. It is always based on math modeling, and because it is abstract enough to lack a right answer, it is judged on how thorough and well justified answers are. Answers come in the form of papers describing the group's strategy, methodology, and results. This year the problem was about crime and evaulating the safety of a city given police report data."},
