		<h3>HELLO</h3>
		<h4>my name is Da-Jin.</h4>
		<p>My real name is 朱大靖, which is pronounced zhu da jing, hence my official english name. 
		My rapper name is dj chu, and my indian name is diraj. I was born in Winchester, but my mom is from Malaysia, and my dad is from Taiwan. 
		They're both native chinese speakers, and got their American citizenships a few years ago.</p>
		<p>Currently, I am a junior at Mass Academy of Math and Science, and I drive forty minutes every morning to get from Bedford to Worcester.
		Because we moved here from Waltham when I was three, I can't remember anything outside of Bedford, so 
		I've always known the same 180 kids, and the switch to Mass Academy was pretty significant.
		Luckily, it appears to be the right decision so far. I'm not falling asleep in class anymore, and we do cool stuff like build websites.</p>
		<!--<p>
		My name ain't Da-Jin<br>
		You're just imagining<br>
		It's dj chu<br>
		And I'd love to meet you<br>
		</p>-->
